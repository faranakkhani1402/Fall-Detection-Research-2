# Fall-Detection-Title (we haven't decided the title name yet).

In this project, I will carry out a further work that have been proposed in [previous project](https://github.com/hoangNguyen210/Fall-Detection-Project-/blob/main/README.md) 
Due to our work haven't been done yet, I will just update our proposed method as well as our result. Our code will be updated after submiting. 
<!-- In this repository, you'll be able to find the python programs written in Jupyter Notebook used for the **Fall Detection Title*.  -->


## Acknowledgements

## Introduction

<a name="general-information"></a>
## General Information
- Understanding the fearful outcomes that falling leads to, developing a fall
detection system is essential than ever before.
- We going to use [UP-Fall Detection](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/19/9/1988) in this project and utilize both machine learning and deep learning on this data.
- Enable to detect a precise fall detection system might significantly mitigate the risk of falling in the ederly

## Dataset description
- You can download UP-Fall Detection dataset in this [link](https://sites.google.com/up.edu.mx/har-up/) . This dataset includes over 850 GB of data from wearable sensors, ambient sensors, and vision equipment. 17 young healthy people with age ranging from 18â€“24 years old were invited to perform 11 different activities. Here is the summary of activities. 

| Activity ID | Description  | Duration (s)  |
| :-----:     | :-:          | :-:           |
|     1        | Falling forward using hands          | 10           |
| 2     | Falling forward using knees          | 10           |
| 3    | Falling backwards         | 10           |
| 4     | Falling sideward          | 10           |
| 5     | Falling sitting in empty chair         | 10           |
| 6     | Walking          | 60           |
| 7     | Standing         | 60           |
| 8     | Sitting          | 60           |
| 9     | Picking up an object         | 10           |
| 10     | Jumping          | 30           |
| 11     | Laying          | 60           |

## Data preprocessing :
- Related to the sensor data, we dropped all duplicate records and removed rows and columns having missing values. We also utilized the index of sensor data to query to vision-based dataset to gurantee 2 kind of datasets have same samples, this step is significant to combine these datasets in when compiling the models.
- In addition, we also applied Standard Scaler and scaling each by divide 255 to warrant our dataset in small range. 

<a name="proposed-method"></a>
## Proposed methods :
- In term of sensor dataset, we proposed 2 machine learning algorithm that win a lot of Kaggle competitions : [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [CatBoost](https://catboost.ai/) and 1 deep learning technique : MLP. Here is some hyperparameters we choose for these algorithms : 

| Models | Hyperparameters  | 
| :-----:     | :-:          |
|     XGBoost        | objective="multi:softprob", <br> learning rate = 0.5, <br> random state = 42,  <br> use label encoder = False, <br> # of estimators = 100 <br>|
| CatBoost     | # of estimators = 500, <br>  random seed = 42, <br> learning rate = 0.25,  <br>      max depth = 12  <br>      |

## Conclusion and Future Work 
There are some things that I need to do with this project in the future
Room for improvement:
- Solved the imbalanced issues in our dataset
- Using more comprehensive architecture in an attempt to acquire higher performance

To do:
- Using the data augmentation method on minority classes
- Utilizing a Mixture of Experts and a 3D-CNN model (in progress)
