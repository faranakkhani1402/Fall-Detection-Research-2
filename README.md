# Fall-Detection-Title (we haven't decided the title name yet).

In this project, I will carry out a further work that have been proposed in [previous project](https://github.com/hoangNguyen210/Fall-Detection-Project-/blob/main/README.md) mainly for camera dataset (C1 and C2).
. Due to our work haven't been done yet, I would just update our proposed method as well as our result. Our code will be updated after submiting. 


## Acknowledgements
- This project was also a part of my **Graduate Thesis** in my final year at university.
- This project was inspired by 2 of my teachers at HCMUS: Thao. V Ha and Binh Nguyen.
- My main responsibilities in this project were implementing code, visualizating our methods as well as results, and writing a paper.
- Our teacher helped me correct my writing mistakes and submitted the paper.



## Project Status
Project is: **_in progress_**. Our goal is to submit to **ISI Q1 Journal**. I have finished our experiment proccess (implement code and visualize result) and currently I am  writting a paper. Other authors help me to revise code as well as check grammar mistakes in our paper. 

## System requirement 
- numpy - version 1.0
- pandas - version 2.0
- tensorflow - version 3.0
- keras - version 
- sklearn - 

**Here is the short form of our paper.** (I changed the pictures of some models for my presentation at Seminar)

## Dataset description
- You can download UP-Fall Detection dataset in this [link](https://sites.google.com/up.edu.mx/har-up/) . This dataset includes over 850 GB of data from wearable sensors, ambient sensors, and vision equipment. 17 young healthy people with age ranging from 18â€“24 years old were invited to perform 11 different activities. Here is the summary of activities. 

| Activity ID | Description  | Duration (s)  |
| :-----:     | :-:          | :-:           |
|     1        | Falling forward using hands          | 10           |
| 2     | Falling forward using knees          | 10           |
| 3    | Falling backwards         | 10           |
| 4     | Falling sideward          | 10           |
| 5     | Falling sitting in empty chair         | 10           |
| 6     | Walking          | 60           |
| 7     | Standing         | 60           |
| 8     | Sitting          | 60           |
| 9     | Picking up an object         | 10           |
| 10     | Jumping          | 30           |
| 11     | Laying          | 60           |
